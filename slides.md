# Definition

‚ÄúA Story Point is a relative unit of measure, decided upon and used by individual Scrum teams, to provide relative estimates of effort for completing requirements‚Äú

# Why Story Points?

---

# Why Story Points?

- **Effort estimation** 
- **Relative estimation** 
- **Team estimation process**
- **Team velocity**
- **Less effort in estimation**

# Why isn't related with time?

# Why isn't related with time?

- Absolute estimation
- Subjectivity
- Affected by people background & skill

# How does Story Points are related with Hours?

## Track time used per Product Backlog Item (PBI)

# Track time used per (PBI)

- **x : 1 = 2x : 2** 
- **overlapping**
- **measure refinement accross time**

# Misconception side effects

---

# Misconception side effects

- **Subjective estimation** 
- **Technical sequence**
- **Evolving Definition of Done (DoD)**
- **Improving domain understanding**
- **Product complexity evolution**
- **Team dynamics**

---

## Subjective estimation

- estimation related with task owner
- costly process

---

## Technical sequence

- handling complexity ahead of time
- difficult with hours easier with SP

---

## Evolving DoD

- could invalidate old estimation
- adapting relative estimation

---

## Improving domain understanding

- better understanding -> better estimation
- affect absolute estimation
- invalidate old estimation

---

## Product complexity evolution

- complexity grows accross time

---

## Team dynamics

- turnover affect estimation
- heterogeneity of team skills
